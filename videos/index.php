<p>Since the discovery of the first extra-solar planet in the '90s, our perspective of the Universe has changed. Over the last two decades a whole host of exotic planet systems have been found, including analogues of famous science-fiction-worlds.</p>
<p>Ruth Angus summarises some of the key discoveries in the field of extra-solar planets and discusses the likelihood of finding Earth II as the number of confirmed exoplanets approaches one-thousand.</p>
<p>From a talk given to a public audience at Oxford University as part of the Physics Flash Talks - A showcase of research at the Oxford Physics Department. </p>
